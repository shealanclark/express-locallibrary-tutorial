The main learning objectives for this tutorial is to learn how to create a dynamic website using node, git, visual code studio, and heroku.

I had a couple small challenges of where I had used the wrong case or mispelled in the code. The biggest challenge I had was trying to fixing my Author update page and book instance. I combed through the code to find any of the before issues I had. I also looked for clues on what the problem was using the error messages, but I was unable to figure those 2 problems out. I even compared my code with the provided code on the tutorial and still couldn't find the problem with the author update page showing up and the book instance showing up once I clicked on a single book instance.
I also am having trouble running heroku in the command line after downloading it.

This is a very useful tutorial and I am glad that I was able to get a much better understanding of the code that goes behind creating a dynamic website. I had the thought of creating a website to post family photos and family history and giving my family the ability to update the database with information and photos. I was thinking about how that would work and this tutorial showed me exactly what I would need to do to make this website to most useful and user friendly.
